**Introduction**
In this project, I developed a comprehensive web-based interface to manage and access a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server. This interface allows remote users to perform various tasks related to file and user management, system monitoring, and backup/restore functionalities. By leveraging a Linux-based server and developing the backend with Python Flask, I ensured that the system is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
The goal was to create a solution where users could interact with the NAS server through a web browser, simplifying tasks like file uploads, user management, and system backups. This documentation provides a detailed walkthrough of the development process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

**Objectives**

The project aimed to achieve the following objectives:
1.	File Management:
Enable users to upload, download, and delete files.
Allow users to create, rename, and delete folders directly from the interface.
2.	User Management:
Provide functionality to create, modify, and delete user accounts.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to assign permissions such as admin, editor, and viewer roles.
4.	System Monitoring:
Monitor disk usage, CPU usage, and system logs to keep track of server health.
5.	Backup and Restore:
Schedule automatic backups of files and configurations.
Provide a restore functionality to recover files and system states from backups.
